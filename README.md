AI class project at McGill, my program won the class tournament, it came out first out of 185 students, won 360 out of 370 games.

My own code is under src/student_player, I provided three programs of various strength with AlphaBetaOptimized being the strongest, it's pretty much the final submitted version except that it's better looking. You can play with the program yourself using "ant gui".

Porject report is in the root folder.
