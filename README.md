# Hus Game AI Engine
AI class project at McGill, read project_specification.pdf to know more about the game of Hus, you can also play the game using "ant gui". 

My program won the class tournament, it came out first out of 185 students, won 360 out of 370 games.

My own code is under src/student_player, I provided three programs of various strength with AlphaBetaOptimized being the strongest, it's pretty much the final submitted version except that it's better looking. You can play with the program yourself using "ant gui".

My project report is in the root folder.
